                       a lua-based templating engine

    ABOUT
        goatee is a lua-based templating engine.

        It has common syntax used across most templating engines.
        goatee also supports including external template files and
        lua files.

        goatee parses input strings into lua code, and then calls
        the lua API to run the code.
        
        goatee comes in two forms - a library to integrate tightly
        with existing code, or an executable that, with enough
        configuration, can work completely standalone.

    BUILDING
        Run `make` on systems with make and gcc. This will generate
        the main library file `libgoatee.a`. To generate the
        executable that can be used, you can run `make exec`. This
        command will generate the file `goatee` in the root
        directory. Run it for more information on how to use it.

    TESTING
        goatee also has some tests available. Run `make test` to
        try them.
