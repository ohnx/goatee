goatee is a lua-based templating engine.

It has common syntax used across most templating engines. goatee also
supports including external template files and lua files.

The engine itself is written in lua, but a C wrapper is used around the lua
code, effectively making it act like C code (the lua file that contains the
templating engine is embedded into the C library at compile-time).

This allows for easy bindings to most languages and for everything to be
packaged into a single archive, without any other dependencies.
